2. Choose to play with the filters and toggle to see which segments you want to potentially view for data (especially when you are unsure of what to look for)
  a. Gender - filter to see all available gender specific data (Women, Men, Total)
  b. Age Group - view available age groups (children, young adults, reproductive age, elderly, adults)
  c. Quarterly/Yearly - some data presented is by quarter per year (Q1-4) or Yearly total
  d. Rural/Urban - some data presented by urban/rural area
  e. Segments - go directly into segments and follow naming conventions from metadata
3. Once you have chosen your designated dataset, you have the option to choose the years you want to specifically view and have the option to download the raw data table
